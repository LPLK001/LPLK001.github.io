    <p>The ownership of Taylor Swift’s catalog returned as a hot topic during a night highlighted by creative
        performances, throwback charm and lots of mask wearing.</p>

    <p>Los Angeles County shattered its daily Covid-19 case record last week, but preparations for a live broadcast of
        the 2020 American Music Awards forged ahead at the Microsoft Theater. The event, which was broadcast by ABC on
        Sunday night, was the latest in a handful of music awards shows that have mounted in-person, indoor productions
        in the last two weeks, including the Country Music Association Awards (which made little mention of the
        pandemic) and the Latin Grammys (which fully acknowledged it).</p>
    <p>The AMAs chose the Latin Grammys route: Dancers and musicians who weren’t singing wore masks, winners collected
        their trophies from a table instead of receiving them from presenters, and the limited audience was relegated to
        the theater’s upper balcony (while cardboard cutouts of Beyoncé and Jay-Z got a front-row view). But despite all
        the visible reminders of the pandemic, winners and presenters had little to say about it or other hot-button
        issues. The evening’s most pointed remark was about as sharp as a butter knife: The host Taraji P. Henson chided
        President Trump by saying, “We ain’t doing no recount,” in reference to the votes for artist of the year.</p>
    <p>While the ceremony leaned toward the tame, a handful of artists managed to make an impression. Here are five of
        the night’s most notable moments.</p>
    <h2>Billie Eilish taunted the camera.</h2>

    <p>She may be destined to play arenas for the rest of her career, but Billie Eilish’s music tends to feel more
        claustrophobic than expansive. Performing her new single, “Therefore I Am,” Eilish packed her live-wire energy
        inside the narrow corridors of a blank but colorfully illuminated set evocative of a James Turrell installation.
        Her brother and collaborator Finneas was on hand, dutifully masked and playing bass.</p>
    <p>The video for “Therefore I Am” — in which Eilish gallivants around an abandoned shopping mall, digging her claws
        into assorted snacks — reeks of mischief. She brought a similar vibe to the AMAs, saucily taunting the camera
        following her around the stage and demonstrating the earned confidence of someone whose rule-bending ways have
        been rewarded. And after two subdued awards show performances — at the Grammys and the Oscars — it was a
        pleasure to see her crank up the energy.</p>

    <h2>Taylor Swift doesn’t love the drama, it loves her.</h2>

    <p>In the run-up to last year’s AMAs, Taylor Swift’s performance celebrating her artist of the decade honor was
        clouded by the question of whether she’d be allowed to play the hits that earned her that title. According to
        Swift, Scooter Braun, the manager who had just acquired the master recordings of her first six albums, was
        trying to block her from doing so. In the end, Swift performed the songs, but the drama has endured, returning
        to the headlines last week as Braun sold her catalog to the investment firm Shamrock Capital.</p>
    <p>Accepting this year’s award for artist of the year in a prerecorded clip, Swift made a point of referencing the
        ongoing saga. “The reason I’m not there tonight is I’m actually rerecording all of my old music in the studio
        where we originally recorded it,” she said, gesturing to her surroundings, seemingly a vocal booth with a zodiac
        wall hanging.</p>

        Swift Says She Will Rerecord Her Old Music. Here’s How.</a>
    <h2>Dua Lipa levitated, actually.</h2>
    <iframe width="600" height="358" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/57bNHupO3MU" frameborder="0"

    <p>In one of a handful of prerecorded segments that supplemented the live broadcast, Dua Lipa joined the party from
        the Royal Albert Hall in London. Typically more comfortable strutting and smoldering than outright dancing, she
        brought her A game for a performance of “Levitating,” attempting more rigorous choreography with assistance from
        a phalanx of leotard-clad backup dancers. When the camera panned away from Lipa in the bridge, it looked to be
        the setup for a wardrobe change. Instead, it led into the evening’s most theatrical moment: Lipa, now harnessed,
        ascended into the theater’s fly space, making for a delightfully literal delivery of the song’s final lyric:
        “I’m levitating.”</p>

    <h2>Bell Biv DeVoe brought old-school charm.</h2>

        alt="Bell Biv DeVoe" title="Bell Biv DeVoe delivered the event’s best throwback." width="600" height="358">
    <p>With its throwback performance, the R&B outfit Bell Biv DeVoe had the most fun with the least fuss. The trio, who
        first appeared at the AMAs in 1991, performed in front of a slapdash, retro set in jewel-tone blazers and
        fedoras, step-touching their way through renditions of “Do Me!” and “Poison,” from their 1990 debut album. The
        overall looseness of the performance set the group apart from the other boy band in the night’s lineup, the
        ever-polished BTS. But with their unmistakably live vocals, BBD scored points in the authenticity department;
        their efforts were made all the more endearing by their commitment to hyping up a nonexistent crowd.</p>
    <h2>Hip-hop claimed some space.</h2>

        alt="Lil Baby" title="Lil Baby rapped on a set resembling a therapist’s office.Credit..." width="600" height="358">
    <p>In recognition of the “undeniable crossover success” of Latin and hip-hop artists, the AMAs introduced a handful
        of new categories this year — a step toward redressing some historical blind spots. Rappers also got significant
        airtime throughout the night, especially compared to last year, when rap’s presence on the AMAs stage started
        and ended with a Travis Scott cameo. Megan Thee Stallion debuted “Body,” from her new album, “Good News” (though
        the song’s spice was somewhat watered down by the network’s censors). Lil Baby delivered a message about mental
        health with a performance of “Emotionally Scarred.” And 24kGoldn joined forces with Iann Dior for a buoyant
        “Mood.”</p>
