            <h1 id="des" >Christmas Sugar Cookies with Easy Icing</h1>
            <p>Let’s kick off the holiday baking season with a Christmas cookie classic. Nothing beats Christmas sugar
                cookies made from scratch and I know you’ll love this particular recipe. We’re using my classic sugar
                cookies and dressing them up for the holidays.</p>
            <p>Trust me when I say this is a sugar cookie recipe you need to try. It’s taken me awhile to find that
                perfectly soft-centered, yet slightly crisp edged recipe. The cookies maintain their cookie cutter shape
                in the oven and have a nice flat surface for decorating. There’s no crazy ingredients, so this recipe is
                easy and approachable for everyone.</p>
            <h2>Easy Glaze Icing</h2>
            <p>But you can create gourmet decorated sugar cookies without even using royal icing! Use my easy glaze
                icing instead. You need confectioners’ sugar, water, vanilla extract, and a touch of corn syrup. The
                corn syrup makes the icing nice and shiny, while the ratio of confectioners’ sugar to water keeps it
                thick. The icing dries hard and slightly crunchy, so you can easily stack these Christmas sugar cookies
                and travel with them.</p>

            <h3>Description </h3>
            <p><i>Cut-out Christmas sugar cookies with crisp edges and soft centers. My icing recipe is so simple,
                    making decorating hassle-free!</i></p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <h4>Cookies</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>3/4 cup (170g) unsalted butter, slightly softened to room temperature</li>
                <li>3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon almond extract (optional, but makes the flavor outstanding)</li>
                <li>2 and 1/4 cups (281g) all-purpose flour (spoon and leveled)</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Easy Icing</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 and 1/2 cups (180g) confectioners’ sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon light corn syrup </li>
                <li>2 – 2.5 Tablespoons (30-38ml) room temperature water</li>
                <li>pinch salt</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Make sure you have allotted enough time (and enough counter space!) to make these cookies. The
                    cookie dough needs to chill, the cookies need to cool completely, and the icing needs 24 hours to
                    completely harden. If enjoying right away and hardened icing isn’t a concern, you’ll only need about
                    4 hours to make these.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter
                    until creamed and smooth – about 1 minute. Add the sugar and beat on high speed until light and
                    fluffy, about 3 or 4 minutes. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Add the egg,
                    vanilla, and almond extract and beat on high until fully combine, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the
                    sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.</li>
                <li>Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl. Turn the mixer down to low and
                    add about half of the flour mixture, beating until just barely combined. Add the rest of the flour
                    and continue mixing until just combined. If the dough still seems too soft, you can add 1 Tablespoon
                    more flour until it is a better consistency for rolling.</li>
                <li>Divide the dough into 2 equal parts. Roll each portion out onto a piece of parchment to about 1/4″
                    thickness. Stack the pieces (with paper) onto a baking sheet, cover lightly, and refrigerate for at
                    least 1-2 hours and up to 2 days. Chilling is mandatory.</li>
                <li>Once chilled, preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line 2-3 large baking sheets with parchment paper or a
                    silicone baking mat. The amount of batches will depend on how large/small you cut your cookies.
                    Remove one of the dough pieces from the refrigerator and using a cookie cutter, cut in shapes.
                    Transfer the cut cookie dough to the prepared baking sheet. Re-roll the remaining dough and continue
                    cutting until all is used.</li>
                <li>Bake for 10-12 minutes, until very lightly colored on top and around the edges. Make sure you rotate
                    the baking sheet halfway through bake time. Allow to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes, then
                    transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before icing. No need to cover the cookies as the cookies
                    cool.
                </li>
                <li>For the icing, whisk the confectioners’ sugar, vanilla, corn syrup, and 2 tablespoons of water in a
                    medium bowl. It should be quite thick. If it is much too thick, add 1/2 Tablespoon more water. If it
                    is much too thin, add 2 more Tablespoons of confectioners’ sugar. If you drizzle a little of the
                    icing with the whisk, the ribbon of icing will hold for a few seconds before melting back into the
                    icing. That is when you know it’s the right consistency and is ready to use. If desired, add liquid
                    or gel food coloring. You can pour some icing into different bowls if using multiple colors. If not
                    decorating right away, cover the icing tightly and keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 days</li>
                <li>Decorate the cooled cookies however you’d like. Squeeze bottles make decorating so easy. You may
                    enjoy right away or you can wait 24 hours for the icing to set and harden– no need to cover the
                    cookies as the icing sets. Once the icing has set, these cookies are great for gifting or for
                    sending. I find they stay soft for about 5 days at room temperature and up to 10 days in the
                    refrigerator.</li>
